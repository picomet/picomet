Picomet
=======

Picomet allows you to build Single Page Applications (SPAs) with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities, seamlessly integrated with Django. What sets this framework apart is its ability to render Alpine.js syntax on the server and to update specific parts of a page by partially rending them on the server.
