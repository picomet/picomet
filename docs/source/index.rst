.. tip:: Picomet isn't stable at this moment. Stability is expected with the 1.0.0 release. Remember to run ``pip install --upgrade picomet`` from time to time, to get the latest features and bug fixes.


Picomet allows you to build Single Page Applications (SPAs) with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities, seamlessly integrated with Django. What sets this framework apart is its ability to render Alpinejs syntax on the server and to update any specific part of a page by partially rending it on the server.
