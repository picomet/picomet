## Introduction

Picomet allows you to build Single Page Applications (SPAs) with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities, seamlessly integrated with Django. What sets this framework apart is its ability to render Alpine.js syntax on the server and to update specific parts of a page by partially rending them on the server.

## Features

-   🏠 Single page app
-   🔎 Partial rendering
-   ⚡ Hot module reload
-   🌲 Alpine.js support
-   🖌️ Tailwind support
